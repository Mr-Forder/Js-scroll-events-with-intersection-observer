# Js-scroll-events-with-intersection-observer

Using Intersection Observer with scroll events in vanilla js to create a 'scroll to activate' feature. A trick commonly used in T's and C's sections, where 
the user is required to read ToS before accepting and continuing.

Full explanation of the proces in app.js comments. Text content is Cat Ipsum.

Perfect for T's + C's sections.
